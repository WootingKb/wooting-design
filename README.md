# Wooting Design Files
This repo contains design files for our keyboards. This includes:
1. Individual STL files for the bottom case and the ANSI and ISO top plates. These are useful for 3D printing. 
2. Step files with all parts combined. These can be used for CAD programs.

Our goal is to promote custom designs and custom accessories for their keyboard. If you have made anything custom please post it on our [discord](https://wooting.io/discord)!
